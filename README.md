# Advanced Dev

A repeat of the basics, followed by API, queuing and image recognition. Written in python. 

## Libraries and Frameworks Used

- **Flask**: A lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python. It's designed with simplicity and flexibility in mind.
- **RabbitMQ**: An asynchronous task queue/job queue based on distributed message passing.
- **TensorFlow**: An end-to-end open-source platform for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources.
- **OpenCV**: A library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision. It is used for image processing and computer vision tasks.
- **Requests**: A simple, yet elegant HTTP library for Python. It allows you to send HTTP requests easily.
- **Pytest**: A framework that makes building simple and scalable test cases easy. It is used for writing and running tests.
